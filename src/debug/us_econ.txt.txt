 Summary:
 With a fast-growing economy, a strong labour market and falling inflation, the US has outpaced its counterparts in Europe and elsewhere.
"It seems like the engine of the US economy continues to hum along where it's sputtering in other nations."
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and energy prices soared, Europe absorbed the impact much more than the US.
Higher energy prices pushed up inflation in Europe, in what experts called a "double-shock" - the pandemic and then Ukraine.
The impact of the Ukraine war on energy prices was a lot worse in Europe than in the US, said Ben Westmore, who oversees surveillance of the US economy for the OECD.

 Summary:
 Europe’s biggest economy shrank last year for the first time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
And the outlook isn’t much brighter: the International Monetary Fund predicts that Germany will be the slowest-growing major economy in 2024, eking out an increase of just 0.5%.
“Germany needs a fundamental economic transformation,” Marcel Fratzcher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, told CNN.
Homegrown troubles Alongside an external environment that has become more hostile to Germany’s outward-facing economy, the country’s internal political climate has worsened.
Businesses such as these, which can find new markets and applications for their know-how, may hold the key to reviving Germany’s moribund economy.

 Summary:
 US business leaders are feeling more bullish about the direction of the economy — even as their worries about the upcoming presidential election mount.
The survey found 36% of CEOs expect economic conditions to improve in the short term, up significantly from 19% last quarter.
In another sign that recession fears are ebbing, just 27% of the CEOs expect economic conditions to worsen over the next six months.
However, business leaders are growing concerned about how the political situation could impact their businesses.
About one-third (32%) of the CEOs report economic conditions to be better than six months ago, up from just 18% at the end of last year.

 Summary:
 Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) underlined the resilience of the Russian economy when it upgraded its forecast growth for this year to 2.6% from 1.1%.
Based on the IMF's figures, the Russian economy grew faster than the whole G7 last year, and will do so again in 2024.
Russia has transformed its economy into a mobilised war economy.
So the shadow battle over Russia's economy is essential to understanding where this conflict and the world economy, is going.
Russia's war economy can not sustain long-term, but has bought the country some extra time.

 Summary:
 After decades of breakneck growth, the Chinese economy is losing steam and the anticipated post-Covid recovery has not materialised.
Under China's leader Xi Jinping, there have been crackdowns on private enterprises from tech to private tutoring.
But in July 2021, the Chinese government banned private, for-profit tutoring in the name of easing the burden on students.
Then the US threatened sanctions against Chinese tech companies over concerns with Beijing's national security legislation.
But is is not just the economy that has prevented some young Chinese from wanting to go home for the festival.

 Summary:
 That has prompted President Joe Biden to repeatedly ask his advisers: Why then are so many Americans still not feeling great about the economy?
While inflation has eased in recent months, prices on most goods are still higher than they were in the spring of 2021.
Still, Biden’s economic advisers are increasingly telling the president in private that they feel optimistic about the direction things are headed.
Historic-high prices that plagued the first few years of the Biden administration continue to moderate, all while economic growth is outpacing expectations.
If those trend lines continue, they have cautiously told Biden, consumer sentiment, too, should begin to course-correct.

 Summary:
 The public’s long-held pessimism about the economy shows signs of easing since last year, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds.
But even with the uptick, many Americans’ views of the economy – and the nation as a whole – remain bleak.
But within the Democratic Party, there’s also a significant age divide, with most younger Democrats less likely to see the economy on the upswing.
About one-third of Democrats younger than 45 (35%) say that the economy is starting to recover, compared with 63% of those 45 and older.
Biden’s approval rating for handling the economy, which hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, currently stands at 37% among the full public.

 Summary:
 Evidence of a strong economy has so far been lost on a general public that still feels the pinch of inflation and worries about the uncertainty of life in 2024.
Signs of a thaw in public opinion, but pessimism still dominates A new CNN poll shows Biden still has a lot of convincing to do: Perception of the economy remains deep under water.
However, if hiring remains strong and inflation keeps falling, it may become easier for Biden to convince voters he’s doing a good job strengthening the economy.
CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that about half the country, 48%, thinks the economy remains in a downturn.
Their letter is proof that the fact of a strong economy is felt, if at all, in different ways.

 Summary:
 A team of five US Treasury Department officials is traveling to Beijing this week for a series of meetings on the economy with their counterparts in China, a Treasury official told CNN on Monday.
The trip by senior officials comes ahead of a planned return to China by Treasury secretary Janet Yellen later in 2024.
Specifically, the Treasury delegation plans to raise China’s use of non-market economic practices and industrial overcapacity, the official said.
The visit marks the first time that the economic working group is meeting in Beijing since it was launched last September after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s trip to China.
However, there is nothing to suggest the latest US-China meeting is in direct response to the renewed concerns about China’s economy and financial markets.

 Summary:
 In Las Vegas, the cacophony of voices, music, ringing slot machines and car horns that typically pulsed through the Las Vegas Strip was replaced by silence, the chirps of birds and the wails of sirens.
Pandemic-driven spike in unemployment In April 2020, the nation’s unemployment rate spiked to 14.8% as more than 21 million jobs were lost, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.
In tourism-dependent Nevada, the unemployment rate rocketed even higher, topping out at 30.6% that month.
“This is an unemployment rate that’s not driven by job losers, this is an unemployment rate driven by job seekers,” he said.
As of December 2023, the Reno metro area’s unemployment rate was just 0.2 percentage points above the nation’s 3.7% rate.
