###  Sorry for the trouble! Please bare with us. We tried our best to keep it simple.  We are students so we can't afford to make this service open to public with our credentials yet.

## INSTRUCTIONS

* Configurations
   
    * Create a service account from https://cloud.google.com, generate service.json file and fill the service.json with your credentials.

    * We are using https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-news-search-api, we included a key for you but in case you get an error like "something is wrong with news api" you have to generate one. (You can get free trial)
    
* Hosting
